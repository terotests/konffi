# Project konffi...! :=)

Konffi adds 

- metadata to the directory (like Git) files
- implements UI to modify files based on the metadata
- runs in browser and uses Doremifa UI

Not every file needs to have metadata associated with it. 

## Location of the metadata

For example README.md is stored into `./fmeta/README.md.fmeta`
